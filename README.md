# TFA-project
This repository includes our TFA final group project written by Weiting Wang and Yuan Yang.

In this project, we will do analysis on dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services.

This project includes two notebooks: Top10.ipynb and Parking.ipynb.

In Top10.ipynb, we found top 10 incident types happened within zipcode 10025.

In Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the ZIP code 10025 than they are in general.
